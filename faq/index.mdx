<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why use TEEs instead of purely cryptographic approaches?">
  You get near-native latency while keeping data encrypted in memory and that's the only way to guarantee that any node and compute provider won't have access to the data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="When will I be able to run production workloads?">
  Post-launch targets follow the SDK beta and security audit sign-off. Expect staged access beginning after the MetaDAO token event.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do pricing and micropayments translate to end users?">
  You configure budgets per agent. Payments stream in sub-dollar increments so your customers only pay for the inference they consume.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What data does Loyal store?">
  Agents keep short-lived context for processing, distill insights into encrypted knowledge graphs, and purge raw data after each session.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How can I contribute before launch?">
  Join working groups, review the lightpaper, and help stress-test threat models in community calls.

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/loyal/loyal-frontend/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable
   - Browser/environment details

### 💡 Suggest Features

Have an idea? We'd love to hear it:

1. Check [existing discussions](https://github.com/loyal/loyal-frontend/discussions)
2. Open a new discussion explaining:
   - The problem your feature solves
   - How it aligns with Loyal's privacy-first mission
   - Potential implementation approach

### 🔧 Submit Code

Ready to contribute code? Follow these steps:

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Bun (recommended) or npm/yarn/pnpm
- Git
- A Solana wallet for testing

### Getting Started

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/loyal-frontend.git
cd loyal-frontend

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your API keys

# Start development server
bun dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

## Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite** (Biome preset) for code quality:

```bash
# Auto-fix formatting and linting issues
bun run ultracite fix

# Check for issues without fixing
bun run ultracite check
```

### Key Standards

- **TypeScript**: Use explicit types, avoid `any`
- **React 19**: Function components, proper hook usage
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation
- **Security**: No XSS vulnerabilities, proper input validation
- **Performance**: Optimize images, avoid unnecessary re-renders

See [.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md) for detailed coding standards.

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Create a feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Write clean, documented code
- Follow existing code patterns
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update tests if applicable

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run linter
bun run ultracite fix

# Build the project
bun run build

# Test in development
bun dev
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We use conventional commits:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add wallet connection retry logic"
git commit -m "fix: resolve ticker loading issue on first load"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new features"
git commit -m "refactor: simplify encryption key derivation"
```

**Commit types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- **Clear title** following conventional commits format
- **Description** explaining what and why
- **Screenshots** for UI changes
- **Testing notes** for reviewers
- Link to related issue if applicable

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Requirements

✅ Code follows Ultracite standards (run `bun run ultracite fix`)
✅ No console.log statements in production code
✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
✅ Builds successfully (`bun run build`)
✅ New features include comments/documentation
✅ UI changes are accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
✅ No new security vulnerabilities introduced

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** run on every PR
2. **Code review** by maintainers
3. **Testing** in staging environment
4. **Approval** and merge by maintainers

We aim to review PRs within 5-7 business days.

## Key Technologies

- **Next.js 15**: App Router, Server Components
- **React 19**: Latest React features
- **Solana**: web3.js, Anchor, wallet adapters
- **Encryption**: WebCrypto API, Nillion
- **Storage**: Irys (Arweave)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion

## Security Considerations

When contributing, keep in mind:

- **Client-side encryption**: All sensitive data must be encrypted before leaving the client
- **No API key exposure**: Never commit API keys or secrets
- **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
- **XSS prevention**: Use proper escaping, avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- **Dependency security**: We scan with Snyk for vulnerabilities

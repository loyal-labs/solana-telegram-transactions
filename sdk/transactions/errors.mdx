## Error Handling

The SDK throws descriptive errors for common issues:

```typescript
try {
  await client.deposit({
    username: "ab", // Too short!
    amountLamports: 100,
  });
} catch (error) {
  // "Username must be between 5 and 32 characters"
}
```

Common errors:
- `"Username must be between 5 and 32 characters"` - Invalid username length
- `"Amount must be greater than 0"` - Invalid deposit amount
- `"Failed to fetch deposit account after transaction"` - Network/confirmation issue

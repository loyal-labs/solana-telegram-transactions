title: "Roadmap"
description: "Loyal is our vision for agentic computer: a secure, private and distributed infrastructure for agentic workflows. We build it with the vision for the infrastructure required to unlock finance, healthcare and law markets for AI-centric applications."
---

## Overview 
Finance, healthcare and law markets are the most privacy-demanding verticals in the world.
Existing solutions are too centralized, too expensive and too slow to meet the needs of these users.

Guaranteed and verifiable privacy is the key to unlock these markets to new incumbents. 
Full-stack development is the only viable solution that can guarantee long-term success and networks effects for Loyal ecosystem.

That means we'll need to:
- Build infrastructure to support private and verifiable inference and execution of agentic workflows.
- Create a user-facing agent that becomes the entry point into agentic workflows.
- Ship and scale first B2C and B2B killer apps that leverage the infrastructure and build the distribution to offer third-party developers.

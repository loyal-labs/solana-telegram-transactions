## Governance Actions

Loyal's treasury is governed through MetaDAO proposals and executed transparently on-chain. In the early stage, treasury strategy has two parallel objectives:

1. Fund product development and operations
2. Manage market structure responsibly via governance-approved actions

During this period, the community authorized a structured buyback program (recurring buys with a maximum price) and approved a liquidity adjustment intended to reduce unnecessary selling pressure from a single-sided liquidity position by withdrawing and burning tokens while retaining withdrawn USDC in the treasury.
